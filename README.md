# Storyteller

## Introduction
Hello! Storyteller (not the final name) Is a work-in-progress Electron app for playing and creating interactive fiction. Specifically, it is designed for **quality-based games**, games where the player is tracked as a collection of integers (qualities), and options are displayed based on the values of those integers. The basic loop is that the player is presented with options based on their qualities, selects one, the results of which alter their qualities and allow new options to be selected. 

The app includes creation tools for making your own worlds which can be shared as .json files.
